# 🌌 Chemosymphony

🚀 **Chemosymphony** is an interactive project that explores the potential for life on ocean worlds, where life thrives beneath thick ice layers, relying on chemosynthesis around hydrothermal vents instead of photosynthesis.

Users embark on a virtual journey aboard the futuristic **Trappist Clipper** spacecraft, experiencing immersive storytelling, scientific insights, and stunning visuals. The project also includes an interactive game that simulates evolution using the genetic algorithm technique.

🔍 Our goal is to explore how life might evolve in extreme environments without sunlight and highlight alternative pathways for life’s emergence in the universe. We aim to encourage curiosity about the diverse possibilities of life beyond our planet!

🎮 **Key Features**:
- 🌠 Immersive interstellar storytelling
- 🔬 Engaging scientific visuals and concepts
- 🧬 Interactive game simulating evolution through AI-driven algorithms
